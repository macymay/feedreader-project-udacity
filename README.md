# Feedreader Testing Project

Created as a project for Udacity's Front-End Nanodegree program by yours truly, Macy McGahee.


## Information / Details / Background

I was given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds as one of the final projects for Udacity's Front-End Nanodegree program. The application already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and the beginning of the first test suite. This is an important project because testing is a large part of the development process and many organizations practice a standard of development known as "test-driven development". I learned how to use Jasmine to write a handful of tests against a pre-existing application as well as fully analyzed various parts of the application including the HTML, CSS and JavaScript which is a very useful skill when joining a new company or simply changing teams within the same company.
